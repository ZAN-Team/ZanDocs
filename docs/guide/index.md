# Introduction
This topic describes the node service provided by the ZAN system. The node service provides end-to-end support for developers to develop Web3 applications on blockchains, from connections in the early stage, development and deployment in the middle stage, to monitoring, operations and maintenance (O&M), and data analysis in the last stage. This enables easy access to the world of Web3. 

## Challenges faced by Web3-Dapp builders
Currently, developers face the following challenges when they develop Web3 applications:
- **Time cost**
   Developers need to consume a large amount of energy, resources, and time to run public blockchain nodes. 

- **Low elasticity**
   Applications are difficult to extend. Each time an application is connected to a chain, the developer needs to repeatedly deploy the node environment.
   As the number of users increases, it is difficult to adapt to the higher requirements for operating resources. 

- **High O&M difficulty**
   Coordinating the O&M management of connections to multiple chains is cumbersome, resource planning is difficult, and troubleshooting is complicated.
   Mature monitoring tools are lacking. 

- **Complicated coordination**
   Because simultaneous processing of data, statuses, and access requests of multiple chains is involved, applications are complicated and unstable. 

- **Lack of tool support**
   For example, support of tools such as development kits, contract security verification tools, and contract templates is lacking. 

## Benefits
