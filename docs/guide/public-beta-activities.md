## Upcoming activities
For users who have participated in the public beta test, in order to further improve and optimize our products to meet your needs, we will invite you to fill out a survey by email. Through the survey, you can actively provide feedback on bugs and optimization suggestions, which will help us better update and enhance our products. In addition, based on the specific situation of your survey, we will randomly select 10 users who provided effective feedback suggestions to be awarded with a one-month free use of ZAN Node Service Enhanced Version (Growth).
